					<h2>Brief History</h2>
					<p>My name is <strong>Justin Bull</strong>, and I am the founder of <strong>JB Design Studio</strong>. I was born in New Westminster. I’ve lived in Abbotsford all my life, but recently moved to Coquitlam. I’m taking New Media and Web Design at <strong>BCIT’s</strong> Burnaby campus. Basically, that is all I will be doing for the next year.</p>

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p>I enjoy <strong>working</strong> with my <strong>hands</strong>. It is a personality trait given to me by my <strong>father</strong>. That combined with curiosity usually ends badly. I’m always taking things apart to see how they work, only to find they don’t go back together as easily. That said, one of my largest passions other than art, is cars. One may tell by looking at my artwork.</p>
					<p>I’m also a very active person. I enjoy playing many sports such as competitive swimming, soccer, and football. One of my favorite summer time activities is mountain trail riding. Many years ago I rode across the kettle valley. It was an experience that words can’t describe.</p>
					<p>My <strong>personality</strong> best reflects my <strong>mother</strong>. I love to write, I perfect everything I do, and I worry too much about appearance. I owe a lot to my parents. I wouldn’t be where I am, or who I am without them.</p>

					<h2>My Favorite Quote</h2>
					<blockquote>"When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know its wrong."</blockquote>
